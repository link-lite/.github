# 📤🐇 Hutch

This is the former home of Hutch, now found [here](https://github.com/health-informatics-uon/hutch) along with other University of Nottingham Health Informatics work.

Hutch is an application that helps allow federated access to perform approved analysis within secure trusted research environments.

It was developed for use as part of [HDR UK](https://github.com/hdruk)'s Cohort Discovery toolsets, and the [TRE-FX project](https://trefx.uk).

# 📤🐇 Hutch

This is the former home of Hutch, now found [here](https://github.com/hdruk/hutch) in the HDR UK GitHub organisation.

Hutch is an application that allows federated access to summary statistics of medical data at an institution.

It consists of a Web application (React frontend, .NET backend API, SQL DB) for users to interact with, and Python-based agents which retrieve the data summaries.

It is being developed for use as part of [HDR UK](https://github.com/hdruk)'s Cohort Discovery toolsets.
